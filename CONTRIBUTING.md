# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to check out our library! Before you get involved with contributing,
please read our guidelines and requirements.

## Guidelines

1. Follow the repository's [**Code of Conduct.**](https://github.com/i0bs/retux/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2. Play nice and be fair. OSS is about cooperation and collaboration, not putting fire under peoples' feet.
3. Contribute with the intent of following our philosophies:
    1. **Simple.** The code should be **simple to understand.**
    2. **Easy-to-use.** Anything accessible by the user-facing client must be **easy to use.**
    3. **Versatile.** For contributions surrounding inputs, keep **versatility** in mind.
    4. **Safe.** Make sure the code is **safe** and the library accounts for user mistakes.
4. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and learn! We're here to grow.

## Requirements

Contributing to our library begins at making an [**Issue for the repository.**](https://github.com/i0bs/retux/issues)
Issues are used to keep track of our milestones for each major version's release, as well as our project board.
We will also pay attention to Issues the most.

When creating an Issue, please keep the following in mind:

- If focused on a feature request, we appreciate design suggestions and how to code them, but isn't required.
- If you fail to check the **Code of Conduct** agreement, your Issue will be closed. We test people on good faith, after all!
- Issues for new features *must* have their appropriate [**Pull Request**](https://github.com/i0bs/retux/pulls) linked to them. You can easily do this via. mentioning it in the Issue *afterwards* or as a comment.
- Code suggestions for potential fixes on bug reports are unnecessary. When one is found, numerous aspects may change depending on severity.

After an Issue is created, please wait a minimum of 24 hours before a developer may give an official response back.
Other Contributors may speak, but do not officially represent the library's face. Contributors are welcome to giving
their own feedback!
